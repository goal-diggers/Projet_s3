    <h1 style="text-align: center; color: #63635e;">Here, you can see our reports !</h1>
    <h4 style="color: #63635e; text-align: center">These reports aim to analyze our progress over the past four months, highlighting what has been accomplished or not, and identifying the reasons behind these outcomes. 
        They are designed to detail how the various tasks were implemented, specifying the functions used, the methods employed, and the tools leveraged to achieve our objectives.
        Another key aspect covered in these reports is the distribution of tasks within the team. We will not only explain how responsibilities were allocated but also why this distribution was chosen, taking into account each team member's skills.
        Lastly, these reports will revisit the various challenges we encountered during the project, whether they were technical, organizational, or related to time management. This will help to better understand the obstacles faced and the solutions applied while drawing valuable lessons for future projects. 
        These documents are not just a means of tracking progress but also a tool for reflection, aimed at continuously improving our processes and practices.</h4>
